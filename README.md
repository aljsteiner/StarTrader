“Save the Planets”: is an economics strategy game with ships carrying necessary resources between planets. The planets and ships are each different economies with a lot of similar rules and some significantly different values. Each economy has 2 very stressed financial sectors, two very successful financial sectors  The other 3 financial sectors are ok.   Generally each year planets increase resources by mining and new staff are added at the lowest grade while many staff move up one or more grades. Ships hold and carry resources and staff between planets, trading resources a planet needs  for surplus resources or staff from the planets but ships generally do not grow new staff and ships generally do not mine resources. 

The game-master changes settings which set overall rules for all ships and planets, thus the game-master sets up many different games of economics strategies.   The game-master sets the difficulty of the game, and the amount of random increases or decreases to the priorities,  costs, growth, etc. There are five clans each with a clan-master.  One or more players can divide up the roles of game-master and clan-masters.  Clans without a clan-master run with the preset settings for that clan.  The clan-masters can alter any of the priority settings and leave unchanged the rest of the clan settings for the robots which calculate the moves for each clan planet and ship.  

Planets and ships which did not have enough infrastructure to survive the year die, all resources and staff are lost, and the economy disappears.  Otherwise when resources and staff are available, growth is applied to resources, staff and knowledge.  After each run a large set of statistics is available to be viewed about the planets and ships,  Runs can be 1 year, 5 years, 10 or 20 years.  Statistics after each run help show the problems the ship and planets faced and may give some ideas about changing clan priorities to increase planet and ship survival.  After viewing their statistics each clan-master changes a few settings then the game-master starts another run.

The game-master changes settings to change the nature of the rules for the planets and ships.  Also the settings determine how the winning score is calculated at the end of each run.  “Save the planets”  game increases the value of the count of the planets and ships that each clan's barters have helped.  The game-master can change settings so that  “Highest worth wins”, or “most planets wins” or many other games.  You can play the game for as many runs as you choose. 

At the start of the year each economy projects what its resources will be at the end of the year,  Each resource and staff sector is given a strategic value  related to how much more is needed for a good year.  In addition, if a planet or ship will not survive the year with the current resources and staff an SOS value is set.  Each year every ship tries to find a planet for a good trade in a way that both of them will be more able to survive and have good growth.  The game-master can adjust how much the ship knows about planets. Ships may know nothing and just make a random choice.  Ships may be able to use a history that is updated every time they trade with a planet,  Ships may be able to get direct knowledge about what planets have to make the best trade, combined with the cost of travel to that planet.

Clan-masters choose a friendship level with each of the other clans.  The higher the friendship, the more a ship and planet will trade.  Ships can trade with each other, if more than one ship is trading at a given planet.  

When a planet or ship has enough to survive the year,  the additional resources determine the health of the planet or ship.  Planets and ships with poor health are less efficient in doing the required work for that year.  This means that the work takes more resources and staff.  In addition, the work becomes more efficient for a sector each year as the knowledge for that sector increases.  

When there are more resources and/or staff than needed for maintenance and travel, those resources and work can be applied to growth in that sector.  Each of the required Maintenance and required Growth require a combination of resources and staff, just as growth requires a combination of resources and staff.  Every year each financial sector will only be able to do the amount of work enabled by the required combination of resources and staff, there will be some resources or staff for each sector which cannot be used.

The resources and staff for each sector are working resources and staff.   Cargo and guests are reserved resources and staff, they do no work and their yearly costs are reduced.

Each year has a Cash Flow activity, the potential costs for each financial sector are calculated.  Any sectors with insufficient prospective resources or work to meet the required level, must move any available reserves to working status.  If that is not enough, costs may be reduced by reducing costs in high resources or staff from working to reserved status.  If that does not work sometimes staff or resources can be repurposed from one sector to another sector, of course the cost of such repurposing is quite high.

The game-master sets a number of priorities and values over the game for all the clans.  The game-master adjusts the difficulty of the game and other options that significantly change the nature of challenges in the game.  A normal goal is to have no more than 10% of ships and 10% of planets die in a single year of the game.  Catastrophes can occur at the year start before it is time to trade.  A catastrophe can destroy a large fraction of the resources for one or two financial sectors, and the staff for a financial sector, but they also benefit some sectors.

The game-master chooses which results are most important for deciding the winner in the game.  The winner may be the clan that gave the most help to clans, or that helped the most planets or the most planets and ships, or had the highest worth, or had the most planets, etc.  The winner will often change after each run of one or more years.  

After players have set clan priorities and other levels, the game-master can run the game for 1,5,10, or 20 years.  When the years are finished, results are available, there are 20 different pages showing different results and showing some of the same results in different ways.  Pages 0,1,2 list the most important results.  Any page with the score at the top will be set to the background color of the clan with the highest score, the winner.

Each planet and ship have seven financial sectors.  Each sector has resources, cargo(resource not working but in reserve), staff, guests(staff not working but in reserve), and knowledge of 3 kinds (common knowledge, new knowledge, and manuals(researchers work to get new knowledge or common knowledge from manual, but trades can only trade manuals).

The jar of the game is available at: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1P-hw8Wk9BcwEdHSS8CdAbDDjtjyEQTF_?usp=sharing
This is a folder because virus protect will not allow passing a jar file.
The folder contains a pdf of this README and the file startrader.jar.  You must have downloaded and installed the latest public Java jre (java runtime environment).  The jre is a version of java.1.8.0_281.
With the jre installed, you should be able to run the game by clicking on the jar.  After reading the story tabe, go to the Settings tab to make any changes.  There are six colored radio buttons, the first is labed “master” for game-master, the clans are labeled red, orange, yellow, green, and blue.  There are 10 sliders for the game-master or a different set for any one of the clan-masters.  The sliders are preset to the existing value, changing a slider causes the named value to be changed.

Hovering over a name, or clicking the name causes an explanation of that sliders action at the bottom of the page.  Many of the names have two sliders, one for planets and one for ships.  For example growths would have a moderate or large growth for planets and a small or zero value of growth for ships.  But the game-master could move the ships slider to have some growth from ships.

I use apache Netbeans, the latest version, and the latest open source of java as well as the latest owned java.8 version of java.  The java being distributed to Windows 10 machines by Oracle is the latest version of java.1.8... jre.  You can download a corresponding JDK from Oracle after signing their license.  StarTrader often does not work with later open source versions of Java because of a class conflict,  Sometimes it is fixed but not every release, .
