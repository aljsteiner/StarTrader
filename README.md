# StarTrader
StarTrader has be in development for the 10 years after my retirement from IT jobs at Universities

StartTrader is a strategy game of trading and helping each other to save the most planets and ships from death because of insufficient staff or resources in one or more financial sectors.  The game-master resets a number of priorities and values for the game.  The game-master adjusts the difficulty of the game and other options that significantly change the nature of challenges in the game.  A normal goal is to have no more than 10% of ships and 10% of planets die in a single year of the game.

The game-master chooses which results are most important for deciding the winner in the game.  The winner may be the clan that gave the most help to clans, or that helped the most planets or the most planets and ships, or had the highest worth, or had the most planets, etc.  The winner will often change after more years have run.  

After players have set their priorities and other levels, the game-master can run the game for 1,5,10, or 20 years.  When the years are finished, results are available, there are 20 different pages showing different results and showing some of the same results in different ways.  Pages 0,1,2 list the most important results.  Any page with the score at the top will be set to the background color of the winner.

Each planet and ship have seven financial sectors.  Each sector has resources, cargo(resource not working but in reserve), staff, guests(staff not working but in reserve), and knowledge of 3 kinds (common knowledge, new knowledge, and manuals(researchers work to get new knowledge or common knowledge from manual, but trades can only trade manuals).
